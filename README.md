## Task 3 - Nonograms

### Project's Description

Nonograms is a puzzle game to reveal a hidden picture by looking at the number clues. The clues are given at the top and left side of the grid. Each number in these clue defines a block of black cell. A number indicates an unbroken line of black cells, and they are in the same order as the lines. These puzzles are often black and white — describing a binary image — but they can also be colored. [Detailed description](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/tasks/nonograms)
