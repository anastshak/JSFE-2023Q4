## Task 5 - Async Race

### Project's Description

We found in the latest news that a new company called "The Fast and the Furious" announced the release of a new product that will really blow people's minds. There isn't a lot of information about this product. All we know is that it's about "easier car management than you can imagine." It's exactly what our thieves ðŸ¦¹ are up to. They're going to release their product in two weeks. But we can't allow them to do that. We must be first.
